# cAc Scribbles

cAc Scribbles is an intentionally expressive typeface modeled after the documentation text found in a specific artist's project sketchbooks. It is intentionally cluttered, although unambiguous. At smaller sizes, legibility is questionable, but reads well at larger sizes, and is effective for headlines and usage where rembembering the content of the written text is desired over rapid comprehension. The design prints well and displays well in interactive design when adequate spacing is allowed. It can also fill small areas with large quantities of text, almost as if the author had more ideas than space.
